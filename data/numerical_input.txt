You are a numerical methods assistant. Solve this numerical PDE problem:

Given the 1D heat equation:
u_t = 0.2 * u_xx  
on the domain x ∈ [0,1], t ∈ [0,1]

Initial condition:
u(x,0) = sin(pi x)

Boundary conditions:
u(0,t) = 0
u(1,t) = 0

Task:
1. Describe an explicit finite difference scheme for this PDE.
2. Provide the stability condition.
3. Compute the solution at t = 0.1 using Δx = 0.1, Δt = 0.005.
4. Provide the numerical value of u(0.5, 0.1).

Return the output as a clean explanation with final numeric value only at the end.
